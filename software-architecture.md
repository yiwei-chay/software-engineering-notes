# Software Architecture Patterns - Microservices

## Evolution of software architecture patterns
Software architecture patterns have evolved from monolithic to multitier and now to microservice-based architecture. Monolithic application is a straight-forwarded way of building a simple application is by building a single piece of code, encapsulating all the data, business logic and user interfaces. However, the limits of this architecture arised when more complex systems are being developed. This is because everything in a system dependent on each other and thus makes testing, development, deployment and debugging extra difficult.
